    <meta property='og:description' content="Hello, I am James Hooper. I grew up in Chattanoga, TN and graduated from the University of TN at Chattanooga with a Bachelor's Degree in Business. I worked my way through college and had a great experience fixing up an old house. I love my hometown, but after college I knew there was something bigger for me waiting. So I bought a truck, said my goodbyes, and moved to Austin, TX. That is where my adventure began in becoming a self-taught web developer."/>
